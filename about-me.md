# :wave: Hi! My name is Crystal.

## About Me
I'm a Korean American writer based in Seattle, where I live with with my partner and our tuxedo cat, Cowboy. In my free time, I like to watch movies, read, write, make art, play games, and try out new skills or hobbies. Pretty normal human stuff! 

For my 9-to-5, I'm a **Technical Content Writer** on the Content Marketing Team at [Educative](https://www.educative.io/). I work alongside some pretty fantastic people, and it leaves me feeling pretty lucky to be around them.
